=head1 ABSTRACT

Register Type Libraries with Namespaces

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package main;

  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use registry;

  $registry;

  # $registry->('main')
  # 'main' Type::Registry object

  # or ...
  # return registry object based on caller
  # registry::access('main')

  # and ...
  # resolve type expressions based on caller
  # registry::lookup('ClassName')

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This pragma is used to associate the calling package with L<Type::Tiny> type
libraries. A C<$registry> variable is made available to the caller to be used
to access registry objects. The variable is a callback (i.e. coderef) which
should be called with a single argument, the namespace whose registry object
you want, otherwise the argument defaults to C<main>.

  package main;

  use strict;
  use warnings;

  use registry 'Types::Standard';
  use registry 'Types::Common::Numeric';
  use registry 'Types::Common::String';

  $registry;

  # resolve type expression using exported variable
  # my $constraint = $registry->('main')->lookup('StrLength[10]')

  # resolve type expression using registry function
  # my $constraint = registry::lookup('StrLength[10]', 'main')

You can configure the calling package to be associated with multiple distinct
type libraries. The exported C<$registry> object can be used to reify type
constraints and resolve type expressions.

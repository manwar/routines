ABSTRACT

    Typeable Method and Function Signatures

SYNOPSIS

      package main;
    
      use strict;
      use warnings;
    
      use routines;
    
      fun hello($name) {
        "hello, $name"
      }
    
      hello("world");

DESCRIPTION

    This pragma is used to provide typeable method and function signtures
    to the calling package, as well as before, after, around, augment and
    override method modifiers.

      package main;
    
      use strict;
      use warnings;
    
      use registry;
      use routines;
    
      fun hello(Str $name) {
        "hello, $name"
      }
    
      hello("world");

    Additionally, when used in concert with the registry pragma, this
    pragma will check to determine whether a Type::Tiny registry object is
    associated with the calling package and if so will use it to reify type
    constraints and resolve type expressions.

      package Example;
    
      use Moo;
    
      use registry;
      use routines;
    
      fun new($class) {
        bless {}, $class
      }
    
      method hello(Str $name) {
        "hello, $name"
      }
    
      around hello(Str $name) {
        $self->{name} = $name;
    
        $self->$orig($name);
      }
    
      1;

    This functionality is based on Function::Parameters and uses Perl's
    keyword plugn API to provide new keywords. As mentioned previously,
    this pragma makes the before, after, around, augment, and override
    method modifiers available to the calling package where that
    functionality is already present in its generic subroutine callback
    form.
